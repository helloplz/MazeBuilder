     * TESTING STRATEGY:
     * 
     * 1. Test basic features of player input individually 
     *      (i.e. Player A move, player B move, player A place wall, 
     *      player B special move)
     * 2. Test boundary conditions associated with player input
     *      (players can't leave board or move through walls, etc)
     * 3. Test win conditions for both players
     * 4. Test full game scenarios for expected progression 
     *      of game states. 
     * 
     * Tests will be done using a combination of error messages to 
     * check for illegal moves, and board state logging to check 
     * for the correct progression of game states.     
     *  
     * Player input for tests will be simulated through hard-coding 
     * sequences of inputs.
